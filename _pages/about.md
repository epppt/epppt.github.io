<p style="text-align: justify">I'm a postdoctoral associate of the <a href="https://www.isri.cmu.edu/">Institute for Software Research</a> in the <a href="https://www.scs.cmu.edu/">School of Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a> in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States of America, where I'm advised by <a href="https://herbsleb.org/">James Herbsleb</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><u>RESEARCH</u>. My research focuses on building a computational theory of the creation, allocation, and deployment of a network of mobile teams producing digital artifacts in a highly distributed complex uncertain environment. Central to this research effort is the socio-technical challenge of the understanding of how coordination unfolds in such open environment, and how and why humans navigate and make decisions in this setting. This multidisciplinary research topic overlaps the fields of computer science, psychology, applied mathematics and statistics, economics and management science, and has many applications in areas ranging from astronomy, medicine, robotics, and cyber security, to crisis management and collaborative writing.</p>

<!-- Central to this research effort is the socio-technical challenge of understanding how coordination unfolds in both open and close platforms and in settings ranging from scientific, open source to commercial, from local to global, from collocated to distributed, from physical or digital,  from centralized to decentralized to hybrid, .... This multidisciplinary research topic overlaps the fields of philosophy, mathematics, computer science, software engineering, machine learning, psychology, sociology and economics, and has many applications in areas from astronomy, medicine, robotics, to open collaborative writing.-->

<!--Most of my current work focuses on large scale coordination in software development work in time-bounded events known as <a href="https://eipapa.github.io/hackathon-planning-kit/hackathons/">hackathons</a>. Specifically, I'm working on the following three projects:-->
<!--<ul style="text-align: justify"><li><b>Hackathon planning kit</b>. Together with my collaborators, I am developing a <a href="https://alexandernolte.github.io/hackathon-planning-kit/index.html">hackathon planning kit</a> that will help organizers to configure their events in a way that fits their goals and purposes.</li>-->
<!--<li><b>TrackHack</b>. This project aims to trace the spread of code from GitHub hackahton projects listed on DevPost to investigate where the code comes from and where the code lives after the hackathon.</li>-->
<!--<li><b>Open collaborative writing with GitHub</b>. This project extracts and samples a collection of open-text projects from GitHub, and zoom into the two projects to identify the best practices for writing with GitHub and then develop processes to aid open collaborative writing.</li></ul></p>-->

<p style="text-align: justify"><u>EDUCATION</u>. I completed my 3-year post-doctoral research program at the Institute for Software Research in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in 2020 after earning a PhD and a MSc (information systems) in 2016 and 2009 respectively from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore where I was mainly affiliated with the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information (WKWSCI), and a BSc (Honors) in computer science from the University of Computer Studies in Yangon (UCSY), Myanmar.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><u>EXPERIENCE</u>. Before CMU, I was a research associate and part-time lecturer at NTU's WKWSCI where I taught information visualization and managing information systems to undergraduate and graduate students, which was preceded by a 13-month application consultant job at NCS, where I involved in the inspection of the accounting module and migration of a web-based outpatient administrative system developed using Microsoft C#, .NET framework and SQL server, as well as for the development of a new tool soliciting patient feedback. I also spent 18 months at the Software Department in UCSY, reading and teaching fundamentals of data structures and a few lectures on operating systems to undergraduate students.</p>
