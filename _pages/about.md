<p style="text-align: justify">I'm a postdoctoral associate of the <a href="https://www.isri.cmu.edu/">Institute for Software Research</a> in the <a href="https://www.scs.cmu.edu/">School of Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a> in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States of America, where I'm advised by <a href="https://herbsleb.org/">James Herbsleb</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><u><b>RESEARCH</b></u>. My research aims at contributing to the coordination theory with a particular focus on the effective and efficient dissemination and coordination of work in an open connected network of mobile networks, each either “adapting” digital artifacts for independent missions or producing work “perfecting” the original digital artifact. Central to this research effort is the socio-technical challenge of the understanding of how coordination unfolds in such a highly connected network of networks, and how and why humans navigate and make decisions in such a setting. This multidisciplinary research topic overlaps the fields of computer science, psychology, applied mathematics and statistics, economics and management science, and has many applications in areas including astronomy, medicine, robotics, and cyber security, crisis management, and collaborative writing.</p>

<!-- Central to this research effort is the socio-technical challenge of understanding how coordination unfolds in both open and close platforms and in settings ranging from scientific, open source to commercial, from local to global, from collocated to distributed, from physical or digital,  from centralized to decentralized to hybrid, .... This multidisciplinary research topic overlaps the fields of philosophy, mathematics, computer science, software engineering, machine learning, psychology, sociology and economics, and has many applications in areas from astronomy, medicine, robotics, to open collaborative writing.-->

<!--Most of my current work focuses on large scale coordination in software development work in time-bounded events known as <a href="https://eipapa.github.io/hackathon-planning-kit/hackathons/">hackathons</a>. Specifically, I'm working on the following three projects:-->
<!--<ul style="text-align: justify"><li><b>Hackathon planning kit</b>. Together with my collaborators, I am developing a <a href="https://alexandernolte.github.io/hackathon-planning-kit/index.html">hackathon planning kit</a> that will help organizers to configure their events in a way that fits their goals and purposes.</li>-->
<!--<li><b>TrackHack</b>. This project aims to trace the spread of code from GitHub hackahton projects listed on DevPost to investigate where the code comes from and where the code lives after the hackathon.</li>-->
<!--<li><b>Open collaborative writing with GitHub</b>. This project extracts and samples a collection of open-text projects from GitHub, and zoom into the two projects to identify the best practices for writing with GitHub and then develop processes to aid open collaborative writing.</li></ul></p>-->

<p style="text-align: justify"><u><b>EDUCATION</b></u>. I completed my 3-year post-doctoral research program at the Institute for Software Research in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in 2020 after receiving a PhD in information science and a MSc in information systems in 2016 and 2009 respectively from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore where I was mainly affiliated with the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information (WKWSCI), and a BSc (Honors) in computer science from the University of Computer Studies in Yangon (UCSY), Myanmar.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><u><b>EXPERIENCE</b></u>. Before CMU, I was a research associate and adjunct lecturer at NTU's WKWSCI where I taught information visualization and managing information systems to undergraduates and graduates, which was preceded by a 13-month job of application consultant at NCS, where I involved in the maintenance of a web-based outpatient administrative system, focusing particularly on billing and accounting module, developed using Microsoft C#, .NET framework and SQL server, and for the development of a new tool soliciting patient feedback and complaints. I also spent 18 months at the Software Department in UCSY as a trainee tutor where I taught to undergraduates fundamentals of data structures and a few lectures on operating systems.</p>
